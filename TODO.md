# To be done

# Short-term
    * Expand ${foo}.
    * Unit tests.
    * Expanding regex matches in targets.
    * Dummy rule for multiple explicit targets
    * Expand `$newprereq`.
    * Expand `$alltargets`.
    * Namelist syntax.

# Long-term
    * Nicer syntax for alternative-shell rules.
    * An attribute to demand n processors for a particular rule. This way
      resource hog rules can be run on their own without disabling parallel
      make.
